# Base C project
A very basic project skeleton with `src`, `include`, and `out` directories, and a Makefile to compile and run the project

# Configuration
Variables are set up in Makefile to change:
- Directory names
- Output file
- Active compiler
- Compiler flags

# Usage
- Place `.c` files in `src`, and `.h` files in `include`.
- Run `make` to compile the project
- Run `make run` to both compile and launch the project
